Synopsis:
A group of people wake up together in a strange land - kind of like Earth but normal textures are
very different in this place. They have to learn to cooperate and connect to the new planet's vibration before they
return to their daily lives. In the end, they realize that they are all connected by a past trauma and are given
a way to help others access the new dimension to realize interconnection and heal.
